The base Ricker model is written in this form to reflect a stochastic process (time ordered and random) by adding the log-normal error term \\(\\tau\\), a normal distributed term often used to account for environmental variability.\n\n\nThis baseline form is then converted into the two following forms of a hierarchical Ricker (1) and a linearized Ricker (2).\n\\[\nR_i = S_i \\cdot e^{\\alpha_i-\\beta_i\\cdot S_i}\\cdot e^{\\tau_i}\n\\]\nWhich is then linearized by log transformation into the form:\n\\[\nlog(\\frac{R_i}{S_i}) = log(\\alpha_i)-\\beta_i \\cdot S_i + \\tau_i\n\\]\nWhere \\(\\tau \\sim Normal(0, \\sigma_\\tau)\\)\nand \\(log(\\alpha_i) \\sim Normal(\\mu Log(\\alpha), SigmaLog(\\alpha))\\),\nand \\(\\mu log(\\alpha_i) \\sim Normal(1.5,5)\\),\nand \\(\\sigma log(\\alpha_i) \\sim InvGamma(0.01,0.01)\\).\nIn this regard, \\(\\alpha\\) is the intercept and \\(\\beta\\) is the slope of the spawner-recruit relationship.
